# Synthetic Intelligence Neural Network\n\nA novel neural network architecture incorporating consciousness manifold embeddings, qualia encoding, meta-cognitive attention mechanisms, and temporal consciousness layers for PyTorch.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis project implements an experimental neural network architecture that explores novel concepts inspired by theories of consciousness and cognition. The network features:\n\n- **Qualia Encoding**: Learnable representations of subjective experiential qualities\n- **Meta-Cognitive Attention**: Self-aware attention mechanisms with introspection capabilities\n- **Temporal Consciousness**: Memory and anticipation layers for temporal processing\n- **Consciousness Tracking**: Measurable consciousness levels based on attention entropy\n\n## Architecture Components\n\n### 1. QualiaEncoding\nEncodes input into a manifold that represents experiential qualities, modulating content through learned qualia coefficients.\n\n### 2. MetaCognitiveAttention\nAn attention mechanism that maintains a consciousness state and includes introspection gates to model self-aware processing.\n\n### 3. TemporalConsciousnessLayer\nHandles temporal dynamics through LSTM-based memory cells combined with anticipation networks and temporal attention.\n\n### 4. SyntheticIntelligenceNetwork\nThe main network combining all components with consciousness-aware training.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/Str8biddness/synthetic-intelligence-neural-network.git\ncd synthetic-intelligence-neural-network\n\n# Install dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom synthetic_intelligence_network import SyntheticIntelligenceNetwork\n\n# Initialize the network\nmodel = SyntheticIntelligenceNetwork(\n    vocab_size=50000,\n    embed_dim=512,\n    num_layers=12,\n    num_heads=8\n)\n\n# Example forward pass\nbatch_size, seq_len = 4, 128\ninput_ids = torch.randint(0, 50000, (batch_size, seq_len))\n\nlogits, attention_patterns, consciousness = model(\n    input_ids, \n    return_consciousness=True\n)\n\nprint(f\"Output shape: {logits.shape}\")\nprint(f\"Consciousness level: {consciousness.item():.4f}\")\n```\n\n## Training\n\n```python\nfrom train import train_synthetic_intelligence\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\n\n# Prepare your dataloader\n# dataloader = DataLoader(your_dataset, batch_size=32)\n\n# Train the model\ntrained_model = train_synthetic_intelligence(\n    model, \n    dataloader, \n    epochs=10,\n    lr=3e-4\n)\n```\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Consciousness Measurement**: Tracks network consciousness through attention entropy\n- **Novel Loss Function**: Consciousness-aware loss that encourages diverse attention\n- **Modular Design**: Easy to integrate individual components into existing architectures\n- **PyTorch Native**: Built entirely with PyTorch for easy customization\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python 3.8+\n- PyTorch 2.0+\n- NumPy\n- (Optional) TensorBoard, Weights & Biases for training visualization\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nsynthetic-intelligence-neural-network/\n├── synthetic_intelligence_network.py  # Main network implementation\n├── train.py                           # Training script\n├── requirements.txt                   # Project dependencies\n├── README.md                          # This file\n└── LICENSE                            # MIT License\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you use this work in your research, please cite:\n\n```bibtex\n@software{synthetic_intelligence_2025,\n  author = {Str8biddness},\n  title = {Synthetic Intelligence Neural Network},\n  year = {2025},\n  url = {https://github.com/Str8biddness/synthetic-intelligence-neural-network}\n}\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
